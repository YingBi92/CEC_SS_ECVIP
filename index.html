<h3><font color="#0000FF">Aim and Scope:</font></h3> 
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Vision is the complex process of deriving meaning from what is seen. The fields of computer vision and image processing have tried to automate tasks that the human visual system can do, with the aim of gaining a high-level understanding of images and videos. Computer vision algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of real-world problems ranging from remote sensing to medical image analysis, video surveillance, human-robot interaction, and computer-aided design. In turn, evolutionary computation methods have been shown to be more efficient than classical optimisation approaches for discontinuous, non-differentiable, multimodal, and noisy problems. They have also demonstrated their ability as robust approaches to cope with the fundamental steps of the computer vision and image processing pipeline (e.g. restoration, segmentation, registration, or tracking). As a result of the convergence of the computer vision and evolutionary computation research fields, many research activities, including special sessions, have arisen in the last two decades. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The proposed special session aims to bring together theories and applications of evolutionary computation techniques to computer vision and image processing problems. In this sense, this special session aims to be a meeting place for researchers in the fields of computer vision and/or evolutionary computation, with the aim of enriching both disciplines by means of the hybridisation of state-of-the-art approaches from those domains. We would like to invite researchers to submit contributions on the topic from all viewpoints, including theoretical issues, algorithms, systems, and applications. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This special session will include theories and applications of all evolutionary computation techniques to various computer vision and image processing problems Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<b>Pablo Mesejo</b> is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (DECSAI) of the University of Granada (UGR, Spain). His main research topic is the analysis and design of machine learning, computer vision and computational intelligence methods able to solve image analysis problems, mainly related to the biomedical domain. He has tackled numerous challenging problems, e.g. the automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in biomedical images (PhD at University of Parma, Italy, performed as a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher, 2010-13), the classification of gastrointestinal lesions from endoscopic videos (postdoc at University of Auvergne, France, in a research lab belonging to CNRS, 2013-14), the estimation of biophysical parameters from fMRI signals (postdoc at Inria, France, 2014-16), and the integration of deep learning into probabilistic generative models for visual and audio recognition in human-robot interaction (starting researcher position at Inria, 2016-18). He joined the UGR in April 2018 as a Marie Curie Experienced Researcher. It is worth mentioning that Marie Curie Standard Individual Fellowships are highly competitive research grants that present a 13.10% success rate (in the H2020-MSCA-IF-2016 call). In turn, the UGR is one of the top institutions in computer science and engineering (ranked 1st in Spain and 101-150 in the world according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020). His Marie Curie proposal (Skeleton-ID) specifically dealt with the application of soft computing and computer vision techniques for the comparison of radiographs in forensic identification. He is co-founder, partner and chief AI officer of Panacea Cooperative Research (a newly-created SME, and UGR spin-off, focused on finding intelligent solutions to solve unmet biomedical needs). He is also the vice-chair of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Task Force on Evolutionary Computer Vision and Image Processing, member of the IEEE CIS Task Force on Evolutionary Deep Learning and Applications, and member of the Andalusian Research Institute on Data Science and Computational Intelligence (DaSCI).
